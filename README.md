- (Static content, dynamic rendering, read-only)

Status: Work in progress 

Status of this page: Also a work in progress 

## Update: March

***The March update supersedes my earlier plans and means some features (such as `gradience`) will be updates later in the site's life. v1.0.0 will still be up March 18th, 2022.***

Due to the amount my life got derailed by moving in mid-February (let's not talk about it save to note that I didn't have access to the computer I code on for three straight weeks and I'm existentially offended by this), and the fact that my university runs on a quarter system so by the time I got my head more or less above water it was finals, the first production version of this essay will be more hard-/hand-coded than I'd otherwise have preferred.

And that's okay.

***Bringing this version up to date is pending (current sprint stop date is March 18th 2022); to see the original roadmap, [click here](READMENOT.md).***
