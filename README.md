# project tag oceanside 

Format: Remix.js website

Purpose: Hosting CHID 480 final project 
- (Static content, dynamic rendering, read-only)

Status: Beta version [live on Netlify](https://oceanside-essay.netlify.app)

Status of this README: Updates pending me recovering from surgery; until then, `big pause`


## Update: March

A full draft of the essay and a functioning framework are live. [Check the issues on this repo](https://github.com/cyrusae/oceanside/issues) for my to-do list.

Bringing this README up to date is pending (current sprint stop date is March 18th 2022); to see the original roadmap, [click here](READMENOT.md).

Greatest concern on my return: elaborated captions for personal photos; parallax backgrounds; animations trigger once visible and respond to reduced motion settings.

For play-by-plays, as usual, [see the ~~p~~**logs**](https://github.com/cyrusae/logs).
