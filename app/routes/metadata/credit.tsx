   <p>This essay was first composed as a final project for CHID 480-A "Upside Down Thinking With the Global South", winter quarter 2022, at the University of Washington. With the exception of specific epigraphs and quotes (see below), all content was produced by Cyrus Eosphoros. Version 1.0 is live as of March 18, 2022; technical improvements are planned but the core content and presentation is in place. If it interests you to do so, <a href='https://github.com/cyrusae/oceanside'>the source code can be viewed on GitHub</a>.</p></div>
