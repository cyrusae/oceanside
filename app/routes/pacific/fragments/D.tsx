    <p>The college in the US that I get into is in Ohio, so I am eighteen and I am in Ohio. Before that, I am seventeen, and my father is helping me pick out a winter coat on the internet, and I am asking him if I should choose the warmest one I see.</p>
    <p>That's overkill, he says. (He has been there before, albeit substantially prior to me even being born.) What I realistically need is more towards the center of the range. I'd regret getting too heavy a coat, he says, and helps me pick one of the middling ones.</p>

    <p>I am given to understand it says enough to say that my first year in Ohio is a lake effect year, though I wouldn't know why. </p>
    <p>I learn, firsthand and on my hands, what a -40 wind chill is in Fahrenheit. I learn what special cane tips I need for traction in snow. I learn that my college is not particularly interested in clearing the sidewalks in time for class; it does not occur to me that they may once at least have been able to afford the negligence, because I don't have any reason to understand a comparison by which this becomes extreme.</p>
    <p>My dad apologizes, though. For leading me wrong, with the coat.</p>
    <p>This isn't what the weather here is supposed to do, he says.</p>

    <p>I FaceTime my dad instead of Skyping, these days. He tells me how many days this week there have been municipal water. I tell him when it snows. He tells me how our temperatures compare. I tell him I got a new monitor. I tell him how much it was new, and how pleased I am with myself for how I found it used, how the deal took a matter of days.</p>
    <p>You're in tech heaven up there, he says. I say, I guess. He says that used here would be new there. I think about that as a way to put it, later: development in relative time over space.</p>
    <p>I say (another day) that I'd like to trade him my laptop, that it would be better for his grip than it's been for my vision. He asks if I want him to talk to ask the guy who sends him stuff from the border what the compounding costs of shipping would look like. I said I thought I'd just bring it to him, when I can. Save him the customs, the way we handled things growing up.</p>
    <p>Oh, he says. That's kind of you.</p>
    <p>I want to see you anyway, I say. The machine being light is the whole point of the thing. I don't see where kindness comes into it.</p>

    <p>The big hurricane whose name I used to remember happened shortly before I was born, and thus the point of reference for an extraordinary storm could comfortably bracket anything I'd know.</p>
    <p>Her usurper comes the summer I turn twenty. It tears through town like a natural disaster, which is jarring. It upends my father's garden, which is, somehow, worse. Thinking of him putting it back together. Even if he had help.</p>
    <p>He doesn't want to visit, after that, even before he can't. Travel has always been a thing of summer; he doesn't want to leave the house to storms unsupervised. He doesn't trust anyone else to handle it if he leaves it alone.</p>

It's hard to find news about hurricanes in the Pacific that I can pick up on passively, though; American sources, which are what the internet is built on, care about the Atlantic first and foremost.

    <p>I wasn't there, I say. It's the first big one where I wasn't there.</p>

    <p>I tell my father that I'm writing about the fingerprints of climate change bracketed by my life. I tell him that a little over a quarter century is a pretty decent frame with which to encapsulate it. I tell him that sometimes it feels like it's following me up.</p>
    <p>You've been working your way north, he says, with some delight at how it lines up. </p>
    <p>Everywhere I go, every year, people tell me that this isn't what the weather usually does, I tell him. I'm getting practice at the premise by now.</p>
    <p>That's their problem, he says. He says it's a fantasy that isn't relevant to the world as it is and will continue being.</p>
    <p>I say I think grounding themselves in what they still think of as normal is how people help themselves understand change.</p>
    <p>He says it's still the case that such ground doesn't exist. I say I know.</p>
