    <p>Let's bow to audience and say I'm in high school, for this one. I've had to move to the capital of the state--during the week; splitting custody will do these things to you--for it. I'm a scholarship student at a private school, for related reasons. At this grade level in my hometown there's only vocational schooling, and it's not mandatory anyway. For the first time in my life,as a result, I am not in the public school system.</p>

I don't know who benefits from that, but it makes the preamble to English-language recipes for Japanese pancakes exhausting.</p>
    <p>I have spent years iterating on the argument this means having, when I can bother. Mayonnaise is common where I'm from, in the desert: mixed with milk as a fat for frying and a topping for seemingly half of all savory dishes you can shake a squirt bottle at it.</p>
    <p>That's disgusting, people tell me in English, and they would like to blame a white person for it.</p>
    <p>Mayonnaise is a shelf-stable emulsion of eggs and oil, I tell them. Who on Earth has the refrigerated trucks to waste on the alternative. Is that really their preferred resource allocation. Is that something they consider worthwhile for a piece of symbolism they made up.</p>
    <p>This does not actually end arguments; for one thing, it requires an understanding of how hard a refrigerated truck has to work for (say) a thousand miles of desert due south on the Highway One as I know it.

I will realize, much later, that this was probably some level of cash under the table; it will not occur to me until adulthood that the truckers brought the rest of the bales to stores, where presumably people would pay for them. My context is just this: the dusty side of a road, a pickup truck, a flatbed full of rectangular prisms that, more and more often, are not the right shade of green.</p>
    <p>She demands he let her break open a bale for inspection, and then finds what she anticipated. This is dry, she says, of the stiff yellow outside; this is wet, of the pliable green inside, too water-dark. They have picked and baled it too soon. It's going to rot.</p>
    <p>The man says it's what he has, which is obviously true. It's about the foreshortening of the growing season; drought and heat and hurricanes that come when they're not supposed to, which is to say the same thing thrice.

    <p>I've lived longer in Seattle than anywhere else in the United States, but not long enough to lose things to the present. I don't have an idea of patterns about it, save in the broadest of senses; this is what I know. </p>
    <p>I check the weather. People ask if it torments me, as the Pacific Northwest is expected to do. My favorite weather is fog: the closest you get to domesticating the eye of a hurricane.</p>
    <p>I don't tell them I'm from a desert--I don't care for psychoanalysis--but I tell them I like precipitation.</p>
    <p>All of it. Always. Even the snow.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry," I say, for lack of anything else to do.</p>
    <p>"It isn't <i>your</i> fault," he says. "I just wish it could've waited." </p>
