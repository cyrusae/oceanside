   <p>A memory too small for me to have a place for it in time: I am barely old enough to remember, and my parents are married, and they are discovering that the dining room floor is uneven, as it happens, as the water pouring in through the closed windows forms a triangular puddle where the exterior walls meet.</p>
   <p>And I am here: sitting in the pool of rainwater with enough room to slap my hands rhythmically on more of it beside me, aware of and ignoring their mounting but generalized disapproval. If it has occurred to me that this is not what they wanted from their recently-finished floor, the thought comes with overall indifference; that they had it poured and sanded, by human hands, so I'm not sure what they expected.</p>
   <p>(Construction of the house I will grow up in has been ongoing, will be much longer, into memories with enough definition to pull their own weight in time. I do not know what a level is.)</p>
   <p>I haven't gotten tired of it yet. As I slap the puddle, I am shouting: "Swimming pool! Swimming pool!"</p>

   <p>Here are two things I know about power, very early in my life:</p>
   <p>The most physically powerful thing in the world is water. Water writes the shape of land and can demolish anything with time. Water in the air is why every inanimate object around me dies faster than it said it <a href='https://www.patreon.com/posts/cw-data-loss-49210295'>would</a>; like optical media you thought backed up something you care about, or elastic. Water bowls you over when you come near it and get cocky enough to turn your back. Water sets the living limits of what is possible: like when the supply turns off, and the tinaco that there's not a one-word English term for is reserved for paying tourists in the back yard to cushion them from scarcity, and I bathe out of a bucket in the shower.</p>
   <p>(It staggers me, the way the North uses wood: like there's enough of it to go around, instead of concrete. I do not make the connection between timber, which awes me as a show of wealth, and forests, which unnerve me; it doesn't connect that anything I see could be sufficient for people to claim it is enough.)</p>
   <p>The best way for a person to acquire power is to be indispensable. My body--I do not yet have the language for this; I always know--my body does not do the things that other people want it to do. People don't want me, if they can afford to. </p>
   <p>But I am also a dual citizen, a term which often means that no one who asks for paperwork other than a passport is going to get something they like. I will have to be indispensable.</p>
   <p>I resolve to go to college in the United States. I will get a diploma in English print and then no one will be able to afford to dislike me enough for them to tell me no.</p>
   <p>(I am, approximately, six years old.)</p>
