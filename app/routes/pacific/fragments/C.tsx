    <p>I am nine years old, and we have family in New Orleans. We have family in Florida, as well; my father has taken it upon himself to drive us from one to the other, which I find exciting. I only see GPS in rental cars, in the US, which is the sort of thing that satellites bother to map. We leave in the afternoon to drive through the night, which I find more exciting still.</p>
    <p>We pass through a storm system, driving; harsh rain in motion at night is a rare treat for me, and I haven't quite grappled with the realities of highways enough to understand the pitfalls of why. I stare out the windows at the hard rain, the luxury of light and lanes on an American interstate.</p>

    <p>My father has told me about hurricane parties, rich people who were recently children taking off to sit it out in spare houses on the coast. The idiocy that comes with the world giving you no reason to believe you're not invulnerable. We may or may not discuss that part explicitly, but I'm aware, at home, of the controversy of the forcible redefinition of "beachfront" property by building on dunes, and the reasons people do so anyway. Why the law has less to say about it than the text claims it's supposed to.</p>
    <p>I know a lot of realtors.</p>
    <p>I also know a joke: "I've got this great piece of land to sell you," it starts, "hasn't flooded since the dinosaurs..."</p>

    <p>Later in the summer, I am not nine years old. When I've recently turned ten, Katrina sweeps through where I am not. I have the vaguest of understandings of what a levee is, from songs, and now from news; like dunes, I think, but worse at being so.</p>
    <p>In the lead-up to landfall, I am childishly, callously baffled: Category 5 on the forecast is always good news for me, because large numbers mean a higher probability of class being called off. (There is, for the duration of my childhood, one paved road. The others, under sufficient pressure, turn to rivers. I live on a hill; I like to watch. One year, later in the decade, on a day that the roads weren't washed out early enough in the morning to get me out of it, my school turns to rapids, and I am unaccountably pleased to know it was built on a vein of red clay as that paints itself onto my socks.) </p>
    <p>Evacuation, for example, is foreign to me. I can't imagine why they're bothering; I could say that the reason I don't understand why one place would be safer than another is that no part of my state is a full fifty miles from the coastline, but I doubt I thought it through that far. I think I simply do not register that locations are unlike one another in time not to learn it on the news.</p>
    <p>I am ten years and almost one month old, and I understand that hurricane preparedness is relative.</p>

    <p>At around four years old, I am eavesdropping--this will be a habit--I am eavesdropping on kindergarten teachers; they are talking about the weather. </p>
    <p>Specifically, they are talking about the ocean getting warmer, and how that's making hurricane season harsher, and longer, in ways no one should like. We depend on hurricanes for freshwater--my town, specifically, relies on them to fill the aquifer its much-discussed oasis status is built upon--but too much water at a time defeats the point, rips topsoil into the sea, runs its course too fast for us to keep. And it's more unpleasant for them than it is for me.</p>
    <p>The warmth, at least, is common sense; I know heat is energy because I know hurricanes need warm water to live. That's why they starve and stall out going north, or coming to land. A storm would have to be very special to fight all the way through that.</p>

    <p>When I am twenty-four, it's <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/climate/climate-changes-hurricane-intensity.html'>established</a> that warmer water is supercharging tropical storms.</p>
    <p>I understand that science moves more slowly than kindergarten teachers' small talk; that climate, by definition, happens on a timescale closer to geological than anecdote. </p>
    <p>But I do have the fleeting thought that, even then, taking twenty years of my life to catch up to how the weather's doing seems a bit much.</p>
